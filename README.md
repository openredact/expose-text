## What is ExposeText?

Dealing with document file formats can be quite painful.
Oftentimes code must be written thatâ€™s specific to one file format.
We have written ExposeText with the goal to make modifying documents as simple as changing Python strings.
A slice of the original document can be directly assigned a new content by using the character indices of the extracted text, all while keeping the document's original formatting.

We published a blog post about ExposeText on [Medium](https://medium.com/@openredact/introducing-exposetext-modify-document-files-as-simply-as-strings-cc5caa5f9c66?source=friends_link&sk=825c8f64dfa4e943b66d1faf351340a2).

## Supported Formats

ExposeText has prototypical support for the following file formats:

- .txt
  - Per default, the encoding is assumed to be UTF-8.
  - You can install [chardet](https://github.com/chardet/chardet) (`pip install chardet`), to automatically detect the encoding.
- .html
  - You can pass either an HTML snippet, an HTML body or a complete HTML document. If you pass a complete HTML document, every text content outside the body is ignored.
  - The output file will always be encoded in UTF-8.
- .docx
  - Only text within `<w:t>` tags (the tags for anything that is text) is exposed. E.g. the mailto link of an e-mail address is not exposed.
- .pdf
  - Per default, text in PDFs can only be replaced with characters that occur in the file (fonts are stored economically in PDF files).
  - If you install the additional dependencies [Poppler (pdftohtml)](https://poppler.freedesktop.org/) and [wkhtmltopdf](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/), the PDF is rerendered and there is no more restriction on the characters that can be used.


## Usage

ExposeText supports files as well as binary data objects.
Depending on your use case you can use one of the following interfaces for making modifications.

### Installation

`expose-text` can be installed from PyPi and has to be installed in a virtual environment (venv or conda for instance)

```bash
pip install expose-text
```

### Slicing API

The slicing API applies each alteration immediately.

Exposing and modifying text inside a file:
```python
>>> from expose_text import FileWrapper
>>>
>>> wrapper = FileWrapper("myfile.docx")
>>> wrapper.text
'This is the content as string.'

>>> wrapper[12:19] = "new content"
>>> wrapper.text
'This is the new content as string.'

>>> wrapper[33] = "!"  # note that you have to use the updated index here
>>> wrapper.text
'This is the new content as string!'

>>> wrapper.save("newfile.docx")
```

If you want to work directly with binary data you have to pass the file format:
```python
>>> from expose_text import BinaryWrapper
>>>
>>> wrapper = BinaryWrapper(my_bytes, ".docx")
>>> wrapper.text
'This is the content as string.'

>>> wrapper[12:19] = "new content"
>>> wrapper.text
'This is the new content as string.'

>>> wrapper.bytes  # get the modified file as bytes
b'...'
```

### Functional API

With the functional API, you can queue several alterations based on the initial indices and then apply them together.
```python
>>> wrapper.text
'This is the content as string.'

>>> wrapper.add_alter(12, 19, "new content")
>>> wrapper.add_alter(29, 30, "!")
>>> wrapper.apply_alters()
>>> wrapper.text
'This is the new content as string!'
```

## Development

### Install requirements

You can install all (production and development) requirements using:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Install the pre-commit hooks

This repository uses git hooks to validate code quality and formatting.

```
pre-commit install
git config --bool flake8.strict true  # Makes the commit fail if flake8 reports an error
```

To run the hooks:
```
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Testing

The tests can be executed with:
```
pytest --doctest-modules --cov-report term --cov=expose_text
```

### Testing in Docker

You can run the test as well in a Docker container:

```bash
docker build -t expose-text
docker run expose-text
```
